analysis - Finding the problem that you are solving for.

class - A simple user defined type.

class member - Integer constants, functions, or typoes that can be defined/intitlilized in either in class or out of class (Private is usually in class and public usually out of class).

data member - Data that is a member of a class.

divide by zero - You cant divide by zero. The computer hardware will detect it and throw an error.

grammar - Rules that have to be used to communicate.

implementation - Actually executing the development part.

interface - Describes the class without actually implmenting anything.

member function - A function that is aprt of a class.

parser - A program that implments a grammar.

private - Implementation details that the users of the class dont have access to.

prototype - Limited intitial version aimed at experimentation.

pseudo code - Code used in the earlier stages of design when your not sure what the notation means. example being a function calc. You dont know how many arugments it will have or how you want the structure of the program to be.

public - User has acess to this and can use it.

syntax analyzer - Another word for parser.

token - is a type like int or char. It can be used to define variables and hold values.

use case - Discussions of design and analysis such as examples of use.
