/*There is a problem, though: if b2â€“4ac is less than zero, then it will fail.
Write a program that can calculate x for a quadratic equation. Create a
function that prints out the roots of a quadratic equation, given a, b, c.
When the program detects an equation with no real roots, have it print
out a message. How do you know that your results are plausible? Can
you check that they are correct?*/
