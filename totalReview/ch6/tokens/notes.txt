A token is a sequence of characters that represents something we consider a unit,
such as a number or an operator. That’s the way a C++ compiler deals with its
source. Actually, “tokenizing” in some form or another is the way most analysis
of text starts. Following the example of C++ expression, we see the need for three
kinds of tokens:
• Floating-point-literals: as defined by C++, e.g., 3.14, 0.274e2, and 42
• Operators: e.g., +, –, *, /, %
• Parentheses: (, )
