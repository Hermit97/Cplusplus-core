1) What is the purpose of working on a program after the first version works? Give a list of reasons?
-To continue testing it for bugs that were not discovered during the first versions development. 
-Rewriting certain parts of the code base that can be improved. 
-Adding features.
-Testing those new features.

2) Why does 1+2; q typed into the calculator not quit after it receives an error?
-The calcualtor program evaluates the 1+2 since the ';' token was given at the end of it printing the result.
The q which comes after the ';' print token is evaluated seperatley hence 1+2; prints =3 and the q
results in an error. 

3) Why did we choose to make a constant character called number? 
-Number represents the number token. Before the constant the value of number was hardcoded when representing 
the token. Creating an constat since the value will not be changing allows for better redablilty and 
avoid speghittei code.

4) Why split main() into two seperatre functions? What does the new function do and why did we split main()?
