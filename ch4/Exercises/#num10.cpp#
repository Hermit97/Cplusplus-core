/*Create a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. One
way to do this is to write a function that will check if a number is prime
(i.e., see if the number can be divided by a prime number smaller than
itself) using a vector of primes in order (so that if the vector is called
primes , primes[0]==2 , primes[1]==3 , primes[2]==5 , etc.). Then write a
loop that goes from 1 to 100, checks each number to see if it is a prime,
and stores each prime found in a vector . Write another loop that lists the
primes you found. You might check your result by comparing your vector
of prime numbers with primes . Consider 2 the first prime.*/

std::vector<int> primes;


bool isNumberPrime(int checkNum){
  for(int i = 2; i <= checkNum / 2; i++){
    if(checkNum % i == 0){
      return false;
      break;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

int main(){

  int num = 100;
  for(int i = 2; i <= num; i++){
    if(isNumberPrime(i))
      primes.push_back(i);
  }

  for(int j = 0; j < primes.size(); j++)
    std::cout << primes[j] << "\n";
