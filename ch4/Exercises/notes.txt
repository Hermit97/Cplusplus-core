Excersise 4 - Number guessing game


Write a program to play a numbers guessing game. The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and your program asks questions to figure out what the number is (e.g., “Is the number you are thinking of less than
50?”). Your program should be able to identify the number after asking
no more than seven questions. Hint: Use the < and <= operators and the
if-else construct.


1. variables

//Lower bound is the smallest possible number
int lowerBound = 1;

//Upper bound is the largest possible number
int upperBound = 100;

int midPoint = (upperBound + lowerBound) / 2; //This will give 50 as the mid point


2. While loop condition
A while loop that runs until both upperBound and lowerBound are equal meaning the answer has been found
OR
While loop that runs for only 7 questoins. If the answer is found before its finidhed the loop breaks out and prints the result.

3. While loop body
int midPoint = (upperBound + lowerBound) / 2; //This will give 50 as the mid point. This is also in the body because every time the loop increments the guess will perform this operation. (NOW try this on a paper using procedure code.)
