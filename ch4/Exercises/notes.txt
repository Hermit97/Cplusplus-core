Find prime numbers between 1 and 100.

Make a function to check if a number is prime.

Find prime numbers by dividing by a prime number smaller than itself.


2 is the first prime number

start loop at 2

To check if a number is prime:

Divide the number by 2.
If the result is a whole number then its not prime.

Find prime numbers by dividing by a prime number smaller than itself.

So 2 is a prime number check if 3 is by dividing it by a smaller prime number which is 2.

Enter a number bigger than 2, if its less than 2 its not a prime and try again, if it is 2 then
its a prime enter more.

Make vector called primes in main function.
push 100 numbers into a vector called numbers from 1 to 100.
sort them by order smallest to largest.
print to see if they are sorted.

check each number in the vector called numbers for prime numbers.
Push all the prime numbers into another vector called primes.
Make for loop to print out all of the prime numbers.
Check to make sure the primes are right by comparing to a prime chart off google etc.


Check if the next number is divisible by 2? Since 2 is a prime number;
