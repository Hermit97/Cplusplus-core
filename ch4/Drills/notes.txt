/*Write a program that plays the game “Rock, Paper, Scissors.” If you are not
familiar with the game do some research (e.g., on the web using Google).
Research is a common task for programmers. Use a switch -statement to
solve this exercise. Also, the machine should give random answers (i.e.,
select the next rock, paper, or scissors randomly). Real randomness is too
hard to provide just now, so just build a vector with a sequence of values
to be used as “the next value.” If you build the vector into the program,
it will always play the same game, so maybe you should let the user en-
ter some values. Try variations to make it less easy for the user to guess
which move the machine will make next.*/

1. Enter either r, s, or p to fill up the computers vector. Press | to exit.
2. Enter user value to test against the computer
3. Use switch statment to write rock paper scissors game logic.

if user = rock  etc.
then iterate over the vector and compare the user input with the vector.

//rock paper scissors
r beats s or r losses to p

s losses to r or s beats p

p beats r or p losses to s
