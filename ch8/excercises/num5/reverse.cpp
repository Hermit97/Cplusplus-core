/*Write two functions that reverse the order of elements in a vector<int> .
For example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 becomes 9, 7, 5, 3, 1. The first reverse function
should produce a new vector with the reversed sequence, leaving its orig-
inal vector unchanged. The other reverse function should reverse the
elements of its vector without using any other vector s (hint: swap ).
